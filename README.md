# ParallelTask

Parallel Task (AKA ParaTask) is an ongoing project under the Paralle and Reconfigurable Computing (PARC) lab at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Parallel Task proposes a programming environment, in which programs can be parallelized with minimal changes required to the sequential version of object-oriented applications. In this effect, Parallel Task offers a set of language constructs that facilitate setting up and configuration of asynchronous tasks. The language constructs thereof are proposed in the form of extended Java keywords for the earlier version of Parallel Task, and are provided as annotations for the later generation of Parallel Task.
